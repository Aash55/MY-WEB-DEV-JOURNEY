<p>Beyond academics, I maintain a keen interest in chess, a pursuit that sharpens my strategic thinking, focus, and decision-making skillsâ€”qualities I find highly relevant to the field of software development. My long-term career goal is to become a professional software developer with a specialization in web development. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, develop scalable solutions, and leverage my knowledge to advance both technological growth and user-centric design in the software industry.</p>
